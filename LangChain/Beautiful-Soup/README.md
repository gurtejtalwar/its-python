# Beautiful Soup

Beautiful Soup is a Python package designed for parsing HTML and XML documents, even those with malformed markup (non-closed tags), hence the name "tag soup." It creates a parse tree for parsed pages, facilitating data extraction from HTML, which is particularly useful for web scraping.

Beautiful Soup provides precise control over HTML content, allowing for specific tag extraction, removal, and content cleaning.

It is well-suited for scenarios where one needs to extract particular information and tidy up HTML content according to specific requirements.

For instance, you can scrape text content within the following HTML tags:
- `<p>`: The paragraph tag, defining a paragraph in HTML and used to group related sentences and/or phrases.
- `<li>`: The list item tag, employed within ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists to define individual items.
- `<div>`: The division tag, a block-level element used to group other inline or block-level elements.
- `<a>`: The anchor tag, utilized to define hyperlinks.
